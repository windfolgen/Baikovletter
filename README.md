# Baikovletter
compute symbol letters for multi-loop planar MPL Feynman integral families

## contents

### BaikovAll.wl
a Mathematica package which generates Baikov representations for a given Feynman integral family by recursively integrating Baikov variables.
### BaikovLetter.wl
a Mathematica package which generates rational letters and algebraic letters for a given multiloop planar MPL Feynman integral family.
### UsageofBaikovLetter.nb
a Mathematica notebook used to demonstrate the usage of above two packages

## issues
Now the package BaikovLetter.wl is not fully polished and the main issue is that the definition of ISPs of an integral family will have an effect on the output. We recommend keeping the definition of ISPs symmetric to those propagators.
