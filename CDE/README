Here we provide the master integrals, UT basis, letters and CDE matrix in the canonical form for pentabox and triplebox integral families.

With "xx" replaced by the name of the integral family "pentabox2m" or "triplebox", 
xx_MIs, xx_UTbasis, xx_Letters and xx_CMatrices are respectively the master integrals, UT basis, letters and coefficient matrices corresponding to each letter.

The complete CDE matrix is obtained by:

CMatrices = Get["xx_CMatrices"];
Letters = Get["xx_Letters"];
CDEmatrix = eps Sum[CMatrices[[ii]] Log[Letters[[ii]]], {ii, Length[Letters]}];
